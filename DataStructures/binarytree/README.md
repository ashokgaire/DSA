## BinaryTree (hierarchical data structures)

A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.


# A Binary Tree node contains following parts.

   * Data
   * Pointer to left child
   * Pointer to right child


## Why Trees?
* 1. One reason to use trees might be because you want to store information that naturally forms a hierarchy. For example, the file system on a computer:

* 2. Trees (with some ordering e.g., BST) provide moderate access/search (quicker than Linked List and slower than arrays).
* 3. Trees provide moderate insertion/deletion (quicker than Arrays and slower than Unordered Linked Lists).
* 4. Like Linked Lists and unlike Arrays, Trees donâ€™t have an upper limit on number of nodes as nodes are linked using pointers.


### Main applications of trees include:
* 1. Manipulate hierarchical data.
* 2. Make information easy to search (see tree traversal).
* 3. Manipulate sorted lists of data.
* 4. As a workflow for compositing digital images for visual effects.
* 5. Router algorithms
* 6. Form of a multi-stage decision-making (see business chess).
